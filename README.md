# Test aggregator

## Problem and Importance


Fluidpay has a simulation tool over on it’s API. That simulates the users behaviour to test the correctness of the API and make sure future development in the API doesn’t break anything. This is an aggregator tool, the purpose of which is to get the results of these tests, save them properly into a database (MySQL) and visualize on the front side.
